Machine Learning Internship Tasks
Overview
This repository contains solutions for machine learning tasks undertaken as part of an internship program. The tasks focus on building machine learning models and performing data-driven analyses to solve real-world problems.
Tasks

1. Predicting Restaurant Ratings
Objective: Develop a regression model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on various features.  
Steps:
Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting it into training and testing sets.
Trained regression models (e.g., linear regression, decision tree regression) and evaluated performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Analyzed the influential features affecting restaurant ratings.

2. Restaurant Recommendation System
Objective: Build a recommendation system for restaurants based on user preferences.  
Steps:
Preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and encoded categorical variables.
Implemented a content-based filtering approach for recommending restaurants matching user preferences (e.g., cuisine, price range).
Tested the recommendation system with sample user inputs and evaluated its effectiveness.

3. Cuisine Classification
Objective: Create a classification model to categorize restaurants by their cuisines.  
Steps:
Preprocessed data, splitting it into training and testing sets.
Trained classification models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) and evaluated performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Analyzed model biases and challenges across different cuisines.

4. Location-Based Analysis
Objective: Perform geographical analysis of restaurants in the dataset.  
Steps:
Visualized the distribution of restaurants using latitude and longitude coordinates.
Grouped restaurants by city/locality and analyzed concentration and patterns.
Extracted insights on average ratings, cuisines, and price ranges for different areas.
